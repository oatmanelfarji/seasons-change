Seasonal Theme Implementation

I have implemented a dynamic seasonal color theme that updates the appearance of buttons, links, and header icons based on the current season.

Changes

1. CSS Variables (
src/styles.css
)

Added seasonal color variables:
--season-spring: Green
--season-summer: Yellow
--season-autumn: Orange
--season-winter: Blue

Created utility classes (.theme-spring, etc.) that map the primary theme color to the season color.
Included dark mode overrides for optimal contrast.

2. Season Theme Handler (
src/components/season-theme-handler.tsx
)

Created a new component that automatically detects the current season.
Applies the corresponding theme class to the document root.

3. Application Integration

Root Component: Mounted SeasonThemeHandler in src/routes/__root.tsx so it runs globally.
Season Utilities: Updated src/lib/season-utils.ts to use the new CSS variables for the season progress bar, ensuring consistency.


Open the application.
The application looks for the current date to determine the season.
Spring: March 20 - June 20
Summer: June 21 - September 21
Autumn: September 22 - December 20
Winter: December 21 - March 19
Verify that Buttons (primary), Links (hover/active), and Header Icons (active) match the color of the season progress bar.
